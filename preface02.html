<h1>Preface: What&#8217;s an étude?</h1>
<p>An étude, according to Wikipedia, is "an instrumental musical composition, usually short and of considerable difficulty, usually designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill."</p>

<h1>What are Études for Erlang?</h1>
<p>In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you
can compose (write) in Erlang. The programs will usually be short,
and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular
Erlang programming concept. Unlike musical études, these programs have not been
designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to
stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find
in the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do">Introducing Erlang</a>.</p>

<section class="sect1" data-type="sect1" id="_how_this_book_was_written">
<h1>How This Book was Written</h1>
<p>While reading the early release version of <em>Introducing Erlang</em>,
I began by copying the examples in the book. (This always helps me
learn the material better.) I then began experimenting with small
programs of my own to make sure I really understood the concepts.
As I continued writing my own examples, I thought they might be useful
to other people as well. I contacted Simon St. Laurent, the author
of Introducing Erlang, and he liked the idea of having these companion
exercises and suggested naming them études.
At some point, the études took on a life of their own,
and you are reading the result now.</p>
<p>I was learning Erlang as I was creating the solutions to the
études, following the
philosophy that "the first way that works is the right way."
Therefore, don&#8217;t be surprised if you see some fairly
naïve code that an expert Erlang programmer would never write.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Many thanks to Simon St. Laurent, who wrote <em>Introducing Erlang</em>. His book
not only got me to begin to understand functional programming, but also made
me realize that it was a lot of fun. Simon also felt that the exercises
I was writing for myself could be useful to others, and he encouraged me
to continue developing them.</p>
