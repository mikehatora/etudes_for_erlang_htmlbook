<h1>Étude 7-1: Simple Higher Order Functions</h1>
<p>In calculus, the derivative of a function is "a measure of how a function
changes as its input changes"
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">Wikipedia</a>). For example,
if an object is traveling at a constant velocity, that velocity is the same
from moment to moment, so the derviative is zero. If an object is falling, its
velocity changes a little bit as the object starts falling, and then falls
faster and faster as time goes by.</p>
<p>You can calculate the rate of change of a function by calculating:
<code>(F(X + Delta) - F(X)) / Delta</code>, where <code>Delta</code> is the interval
between measurements. As Delta approaches zero, you get closer and
closer to the true value of the derivative.</p>
<p>Write a module named <code>calculus</code> with a function <code>derivative/2</code>. The
first argument is the function whose derivative you wish to find, and the
second argument is the point at which you are measuring the derivative.</p>
<p>What should you use for a value of <code>Delta</code>? I used <code>1.0e-10</code>, as that is a small
number that approaches zero.</p>
<p>Here is some sample output.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; c(calculus).

<li><p>Line 3 is a test to see if the <code>F1</code> function works.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 5 shows that you don&#8217;t have to assign a function to a variable;
you can define the function in line.</p></li>
<li><p>Line 6 shows how to refer to a function in another module. You start
with the word <code>fun</code> followed by the <code><em>module</em>:<em>function</em>/<em>arity</em></code>.</p></li>

<h1>Étude 7-2: List Comprehensions and Pattern Matching</h1>
<p>Is it possible to use pattern matching inside a list comprehension? Try
it and find out.</p>
<p>Presume you have this list of people&#8217;s names, genders, and ages:</p>
<pre>People = [{"Federico", $M, 22}, {"Kim", $F, 45}, {"Hansa", $F, 30},
{"Tran", $M, 47}, {"Cathy", $F, 32}, {"Elias", $M, 50}].</pre>




<section class="sect2" data-type="sect2" id="_part_one">
<h2>Part One</h2>
<p>In <code>erl</code> (or in a module, if you prefer), write a list comprehension
that creates a list consisting of the names of all males who are over 40.
Use pattern matching
to separate the tuple into three variables, and two guards to do the
tests for age and gender.</p>
</section>






<section class="sect2" data-type="sect2" id="_part_two">
<h2>Part Two</h2>
<p>When you use multiple guards in a list comprehension, you get the moral
equivalent of <code>and</code> for each condition you are testing. If you want an
<code>or</code> condition, you must test it explicitly. Write a list comprehension
that selects the names of all the people who are male <em>or</em> over 40. You
will need one guard with an <code>or</code>; you may also use <code>orelse</code>.</p>
<div data-type="note" class="note">
Because <code>or</code> has higher priority than comparison operators like <code>&lt;</code> and
<code>==</code>, an expression like <code>X &gt; 5 or X &lt; 12</code> will generate an error, as
Erlang interprets it to mean <code>X &gt; (5 or X) &lt; 12</code>. Use parentheses to force
the correct evaluation: <code>(X &gt; 5) or (X &lt; 12)</code>. If you use <code>orelse</code>, which
has a lower priority than the comparison operators, you don&#8217;t need the
parentheses, though it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have them. Another advantage of
<code>orelse</code> is that it doesn&#8217;t do any unnecessary comparisons.

<h1>Étude 7-3: Using <code>lists:foldl/3</code></h1>
<p>Add <code>mean/1</code> and <code>stdv/1</code> functions to the <code>stats</code> module which
you created in <a data-type="xref" href="#CH06-02">Étude 6-2</a> to calculate the mean and
standard deviation for a list of numbers.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; c(stats).
{ok,stats}
2&gt; stats:mean([7, 2, 9]).
6.0
3&gt; stats:stdv([7, 2, 9]).
3.605551275463989</pre>
<p>The formula for the mean is simple; just add up all the numbers and
divide by the number of items in the list (which you may find by using the
<code>length/1</code> function).Use <code>lists:foldl/3</code> to calculate the sum of the items
in the list.</p>
<p>The following is the algorithm for calculating
the standard deviation. Presume that <code>N</code> is the number of items
in the list.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Add up all the numbers in the list (call this the <em>sum</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Add the squares of the numbers in the list (call this the <em>sum of squares</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Multiply <code>N</code> times the <em>sum of squares</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiply the <em>sum</em> times itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtract the result of step 4 from the result of step 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide the result of step 5 by <code>N * (N - 1)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the square root of that result.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, if your numbers are 7, 2, and 9, <code>N</code> would be three, and
you would do these calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The sum is 7 + 2 + 9, or 18.</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of squares is 49 + 4 + 81, or 134.</p></li>
<li><p><code>N</code> times the sum of squares is 134 * 3, or 402.</p></li>
<li><p>The sum times itself is 18 * 18, or 324.</p></li>
<li><p>402 - 324 is 78.</p></li>
<li><p>78 divided by (3 * (3 - 1)) is 78 / 6, or 13.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard deviation is the square root of 13, or 3.606.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your code, you can do steps three through seven in one arithmetic
expression. You&#8217;d have variables in your expression rather than constants,
of course.</p>
<pre>math:sqrt((3 * 134 - 18 * 18)/(3 * (3 - 1))</pre>
<p>Use <code>lists:foldl/3</code> to calculate the sum and the sum of squares.
Bonus points if you can calculate both of them
with one call to <code>lists:foldl/3</code>. Hint:
the argument for the accumulator doesn&#8217;t have to be a single number. It can
be a list or a tuple.</p>

<h1>Étude 7-4: Using <code>lists:split/2</code></h1>

<h1>Étude 7-5: Multiple Generators in List Comprehensions</h1>
<p>Back to list comprehensions. You can have more than one generator in a list
comprehension. Try this in <code>erl</code>:</p>

<p>Using what you&#8217;ve learned from this example, write a module named <code>cards</code>
that contains a function <code>make_deck/0</code>. The function will generate a deck
of cards as a list 52 tuples in this form:</p>

 {"A","Diamonds"},
 {"A","Hearts"},
 {"A","Spades"},
 {2,"Clubs"},
 {2,"Diamonds"},

 {"K", "Diamonds"},
 {"K", "Hearts"},
 {"K", "Spades"}]</pre>
<div data-type="note" class="note">
<p>When you run this function, your output will not show the entire list; it will

<h1>Étude 7-6: Explaining an Algorithm</h1>
<p>You need a way to shuffle the deck of cards. This is the code for
doing a shuffle, taken from the Literate Programs Wiki.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erlang">shuffle(List) -&gt; shuffle(List, []).

<p>Wait a moment. If I&#8217;ve just given you the code, what&#8217;s the purpose
of this étude? I want you to understand the code. The object of this
étude is to write the documentation for the algorithm.
If you aren&#8217;t sure what the code does, try adding some
<code>io:format</code> statements to see what is happening. If you&#8217;re totally
