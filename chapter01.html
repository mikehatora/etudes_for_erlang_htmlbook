<h1>Étude 1-1: Experimenting with Errors</h1>
<p>The first chapter of
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do">Introducing Erlang</a>
encourages you to play around with the interactive <code>erl</code> system.
In this étude, keep using <code>erl</code>, but purposely make errors.</p>
<p>Try leaving out parentheses in arithmetic expressions. Try putting
numbers next to each other without an operator between them.
Try adding <code>"adam"</code> to <code>12</code>. Make up variable names that you are sure
Erlang wouldn&#8217;t ever accept.</p>
<p>That way, you&#8217;ll get a feel for the sort of error messages
Erlang produces and not be as baffled when you get errors that
you aren&#8217;t expecting.</p>
