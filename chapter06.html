<h1>Étude 6-1: Recursive Iteration through a List</h1>
<p>In a module named <code>stats</code>, write a function named <code>minimum/1</code>. It takes
a list of numbers as its argument and returns the smallest value. This
function already exists in the <code>lists</code> module (<code>lists:min/1</code>), but it&#8217;s
a good exercise in learning about recursion.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the pseudocode for <code>minimum/1</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Split the list into the first number and the remainder of the list using
the cons operator <code>|</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Call function <code>minimum/2</code>, which takes a list as its first argument and
the "smallest number so far" (the <em>current candidate</em>) as its second argument.
Use the remainder of the list (which you extracted in the previous step) as
the first argument to <code>minimum/2</code>, and the first item in the list as the second
argument.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s the pseudocode for <code>minimum/2</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the list passed to <code>minimum/2</code> is empty, the final result is the current
candidate. This stops the recursion.</p></li>
<li><p>If the list passed to <code>minimum/2</code> is not empty, then see if the head of
the list is less than the current candidate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If so, call <code>minimum/2</code> with the tail of the list as the first argument
and the list head (the new "smallest number") as the second argument.</p></li>
<li><p>If not, call <code>minimum/2</code> with the tail of the list as the first argument
and the current candidate (still the "smallest number")
as the second argument.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike most examples in
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do">Introducing Erlang</a>,
passing an empty list to this
function will make it crash. That&#8217;s a reasonable thing to do, as an empty
list can&#8217;t really be said to have a minimum value.</p>

<h1>Étude 6-3: Accumulating the Sum of a List</h1>
<p>Add a function <code>julian/1</code> to the <code>dates</code> module that you wrote in
<a data-type="xref" href="#CH05-ET02">Étude 5-2</a>. Given a string in ISO format (<code>"yyyy-mm-dd"</code>), it
returns the Julian date: the day of the year.</p>
<p>Here is some sample output.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; c(dates).
{ok,dates}
2&gt; dates:julian("2012-12-31").
366
3&gt; dates:julian("2013-12-31").
365
4&gt; dates:julian("2012-02-05").

61
126&gt; dates:julian("2013-01-01").

<p>The <code>julian/1</code> function defines a 12-item list called <code>DaysPerMonth</code> that
contains the number of days in each month, splits the date into
the year, month, and day (using the <code>date_parts/1</code> function you wrote in
<a data-type="xref" href="#CH05-ET02">Étude 5-2</a>, and then calls helper function <code>julian/5</code> (yes,
five arguments).</p>
<p>The <code>julian/5</code> function does all of the work. Its arguments are the year,
month, day, the list of days per month, and an accumulated total, which
starts at zero. <code>julian/5</code> takes the head of the days per month list and
adds it to the accumulator, and then calls <code>julian/5</code> again with the
tail of the days per month list and the accumulator value as its last two
arguments.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take, as an example, the sequence of calls for April 18, 2013:</p>
<pre>julian(2013, 4, 18, [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], 0).
julian(2013, 4, 18, [28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], 31).
julian(2013, 4, 18, [31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], 59).
julian(2013, 4, 18, [30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31], 90).</pre>
<p>At this point, the accumulator has all the days up through the beginning of
April, so the last call to <code>julian/5</code> just adds the 18 remaining days
and yields 108 as its result.</p>
<p>You know you are doing the last call when you have "used up"
the first <em>month-1</em> items in
the list of days per month. That happens <code>when</code> the month number is greater
than <code>(13 - length(<em>days_per_month_list</em>))</code>. Hint: use a guard.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s still the problem of leap years. You can handle it in
either <code>julian/5</code> or <code>julian/1</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to do the work in <code>julian/5</code>, then for non-leap years,
the last call to <code>julian/5</code> adds the number of days in the target month.
For leap years, the function must add the number of days in the
target month plus one&#8212;but only if the month is after February.</p>
<p>If you want to do the work in <code>julian/5</code>, use a <code>case</code> to assign either
<code>28</code> or <code>29</code> to a variable named <code>DaysInFeb</code> (depending on whether the
year is a leap year), and then use that variable instead of 28 when you
construct your original days per month list.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you the code for the <code>is_leap_year/1</code> function for free; it returns
<code>true</code> if the given year is a leap year, <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<section class="sect1" data-type="sect1" id="CH06-INTERLUDE">
<h1>Interlude: "Mistakes were made."</h1>
<p>As I was writing the next two études, I tried, despite the examples in the
book, to avoid using <code>lists:reverse/1</code>. I thought, "Why <em>can&#8217;t</em> I add items
to the end of a list using the cons (vertical bar; <code>|</code>) notation?" Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>I decided to do a simple task: take a list of numbers and return a list
consisting of the squares of the numbers. I tried adding new items to the end
of the list with this code:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erlang">-module(bad_code).
-export([squares/1]).

squares(Numbers) -&gt; squares(Numbers, []).

squares([], Result) -&gt; Result;

squares([H | T], Result) -&gt; squares(T, [Result | H * H ]).</pre>
<p>The resulting list was in the correct order, but it was an improper list.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; c(bad_code).
{ok,bad_code}
2&gt; bad_code:squares([9, 4.22, 5]).
[[[[]|81]|17.8084]|25]</pre>
<p>That didn&#8217;t work. Wait a minute&#8212;the book said that the right hand side of the
cons (<code>|</code>) operator should be a list. "OK, you want a list?" I thought.
"I&#8217;ve got your list right here." (See the last
line of the code, where I wrap the new item in square brackets.)</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erlang">squares2(Numbers) -&gt; squares2(Numbers, []).

squares2([], Result) -&gt; Result;

squares2([H | T], Result) -&gt; squares2(T, [Result | [H * H] ]).</pre>
<p>There. That should do the trick.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">6&gt; c(bad_code).
{ok,bad_code}
7&gt; bad_code:squares2([9, 4.22, 5]).
[[[[],81],17.8084],25]</pre>
<p>The result was better, but only slightly better. I didn&#8217;t have an improper list
any more, but now I had a list of list of list of lists.
I could fix the problem by changing one line to flatten the final result.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erlang">squares2([], Result) -&gt; lists:flatten(Result);</pre>
<p>That worked, but it wasn&#8217;t a satisfying solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The longer the original list, the more deeply nested the final list
would be,</p></li>
<li><p>I still had to call a function from the <code>lists</code> module, and</p></li>
<li><p>A look at <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/listHandling.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/listHandling.html</a> showed
that <code>lists:flatten</code> is a very expensive operation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In light of all of this, I decided to use <code>lists:reverse/1</code> and write
the code to generate a proper, non-nested list.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erlang">-module(good_code).
-export([correct_squares/1]).

correct_squares(Numbers) -&gt; correct_squares(Numbers, []).

correct_squares([], Result) -&gt; lists:reverse(Result);

correct_squares([H | T], Result) -&gt;
  correct_squares(T, [H * H | Result]).</pre>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; c(good_code).
{ok,good_code}
2&gt; good_code:correct_squares([9, 4.22, 5]).
[81,17.8084,25]</pre>
<p>Success at last!  The moral of the story?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RTFM (Read the Fabulous Manual).</p></li>
<li><p>Believe what you read.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t believe what you read, try it and find out.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t worry if you make this sort of mistake. You won&#8217;t be the first person
to do so, and you certainly won&#8217;t be the last.</p></li>

<h1>Étude 6-4: Lists of Lists</h1>
<p>Dentists check the health of your gums by checking the depth of the "pockets"

The depth is measured in millimeters. If any of the depths is greater
than or equal to four millimeters, that tooth needs attention. (Thanks to
Dr. Patricia Lee, DDS, for explaining this to me.)</p>
<p>Your task is to write a module named <code>teeth</code> and a function named

input. If a tooth isn&#8217;t present, it is represented by the list
<code>[0]</code> instead of a list of six numbers. The function produces
a list of the tooth numbers that require attention.  The numbers
must be in ascending order.</p>

<h1>Étude 6-5: Random Numbers; Generating Lists of Lists</h1>
<p>How do you think I got the numbers for the teeth in the preceding étude?
Do you really think I made up and typed all 180 of them? No, of course not.
Instead, I wrote an Erlang program to create the list of lists for me,
and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll do in this étude.</p>
<p>In order to create the data for the teeth,
I had to generate random numbers with Erlang&#8217;s
<code>random</code> module. Try generating a random number uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1.0 by typing this in <code>erl</code>:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; random:uniform().
0.4435846174457203</pre>
<p>Now, exit <code>erl</code>, restart, and type the same command again. You&#8217;ll get the
same number. In order to ensure that you get different sets of random numbers,
you have to <em>seed</em> the random number generator with a three-tuple. The easiest
way to get a different seed every time you run the program is to use the
<code>now/0</code> built-in function, which returns a different three-tuple every time
you call it.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; now().
{1356,887000,432535}
2&gt; now().
{1356,887002,15527}
3&gt; now().
{1356,887003,831752}</pre>
<p>Exit <code>erl</code>, restart, it and try these commands. Do this a couple of times to
convince yourself that you really get different random numbers. Don&#8217;t worry
about the <code>undefined</code>; that&#8217;s just Erlang&#8217;s way of telling you that the
random number generator wasn&#8217;t seeded before.</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="programlisting" data-code-language="erl">1&gt; random:seed(now()).
undefined
2&gt; random:uniform().
0.27846009966109264</pre>
<p>If you want to generate a random integer between 1 and <code>N</code>, use
<code>uniform/1</code>; thus <code>random:uniform(10)</code> will generate a
random integer from 1 to 10.</p>
<p>Functions that use random numbers have side effects; unlike the <code>sin</code> or
<code>sqrt</code> function, which always gives you the same numbers for the same input,
functions that use random numbers should always give you different numbers
for the same input. Since these functions aren&#8217;t "pure," it&#8217;s best to isolate
them in a module of their own.</p>
<p>In this étude, create a module named <code>non_fp</code>, and write a function
<code>generate_teeth/2</code>. This function has a string consisting of the characters
<code>T</code> and <code>F</code> for its first argument.
A <code>T</code> in the string indicates that the tooth is present, and a
<code>F</code> indicates a missing tooth. In Erlang, a string is a list of characters,
so you can treat this string just as you would any other list. Remember to
refer to individual characters as <code>$T</code> and <code>$F</code>.</p>
<p>The second argument is a floating point
number between 0 and 1.0 that indicates the probability that a tooth will be
a good tooth.</p>
<p>These are the helper functions I needed:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>generate_teeth/3</code></dt>
<dd><p>The first two arguments are the same as for <code>generate_teeth/2</code>; the
third argument is the accumulated list. When the first argument is
an empty list, the function yields the reverse of the accumulated list.</p></dd>
<dt><code>generate_tooth/1</code></dt>
<dd><p>This generates the list of numbers for a single tooth. It generates a
random number between 0 and 1. If that number is less than the probability
of a good tooth, it sets the "base depth" to 2, otherwise it sets the base depth to 3.</p></dd>
<dt><code>generate_tooth/3</code></dt>
<dd><p>The first argument is the base depth, the second is the number of items
left to generate, and the third argument is the accumulated list. When
the number of items hits zero, the function is finished. Otherwise, it
adds a random integer between -1 and 1 to the base depth,
adds it to the accumulated list, and does a recursive call with
one less item.</p></dd>
